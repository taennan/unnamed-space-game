# Unnamed Space Game

A space shooter were forethought, patience and timing hold center stage. Why get involved in mindless shooting and destruction when the laws of physics can turn a two player deathmatch into a complex mindgame? 

Curve your shots around gravitational fields, jump across spacetime with wormholes, manage your cannon, shields and fuel levels... this game was never meant for those who like to jump in and out of a quick shooting match

Runs on macOS only

# Disclaimer

Unlike my other early Swift projects, this game is still **very much** incomplete... and will likely remain incomplete for the for the foreseable future.

Sorry
